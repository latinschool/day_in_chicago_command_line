#A Day in Chicago
##Command Line Edition

To start this exercise, enter this in your terminal: git clone 
(you’re not going to upload this to github, so cloning my copy is okay)


Instructions: Follow the challenges below using this key of command line (generic name for terminal) commands. Note, folders will signify places while .txt files will signify things. If you are not sure how to do one, move on



START BY SAVING A KITTEN FROM A TREE
It’s a typical Saturday Morning. You finish watching your Saturday morning cartoons when all of a sudden Grandma calls! She was walking her cat in lincoln park when it got stuck in a tree!

Navigate to lincoln_park and find grandma’s kitten.

Make sure it gets home, to Grandma’s house safely. 


HINT: use the move command with relative or direct paths
(a direct path would be what you see when you type PWD)
